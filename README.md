# Project Motivation

I wanted to find answers to some questions about the features of rooms/houses rented through Airbnb by using the Seattle Airbnb dataset available on Kaggle.

Here are the questions

- Which amenities are most common. list first three? (list using a word cloud)
- What is the relationship between numeric columns, especially price ?
- What is the relationship between price, price range and other categorical columns? (neighbourhood, property_type, room_type, bed_type)

I shared the results of my exploratory data analysis for the answers to my questions in a Medium blog post with visualizations.
